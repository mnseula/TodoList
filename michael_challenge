An ant is sitting on a grid of white and black squares. Initially the grid is all white and the ant faces right.  At each step it does the following:
At a white square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees right (clockwise), and move forward one unit.

At a black square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees left (counterclockwise), and move forward one unit

I am going to create this interface in react and using Node Package Manager, create npx create-react-app ant
once the project is installed under  create a directory under scr called components:

in this folder copy two files namely Board.js and Board.css, the file App.js will go in the main file and replace the App.js that was already created in the src folder. 

Once the packages are installed run npm start and open your browser to this address:  http://localhost:3000/ and you will get the 3X3 grid that will simulate the mouse movements.
